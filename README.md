This tutorial briefly explains how to setup LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs bot. With few modifications you can make your own bot or try my other bots for other platforms.

2. Install Python. My version is 3.9 .6
3. Download Geckodriver put it in Python’s installation folder.
4. Install pip, python get-pip.py
5. Install selenium pip install selenium
6. Download the linkedineassyapply.py code
7. Create a profile on Firefox, about:profiles
8. Launch new profile, go Linkedin.com and log in your account
9. Copy the root folder of your new profile, to do that type about:profiles on your Firefox search bar, copy the root folder C:\---\your-profile-name.
10. Paste the root folder on webdriver.Firefox(“root-directory”) line
11. Modify/adapt the code and run
12. After each run check the jobs that the bot didn’t apply automatically, apply them manually by saving your preferences
13. Next time the bot will apply more jobs based on your saved preferences on Linkedin.
14. Feel free to contact with my for any update/request or question.
